# Image Generation of Numbers Using MNIST Dataset and DCGAN

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate image generation using the MNIST dataset and Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN).

## Project Overview

The notebooks provided offer an in-depth exploration of generating digit images by training a DCGAN on the MNIST dataset, a widely used resource for machine learning in image recognition.

## Features

- **MNIST Dataset Loading:** Efficient loading and preprocessing of the MNIST dataset.
- **DCGAN Architecture:** Building and training a DCGAN to generate new images of handwritten digits.
- **Visualization:** Visualizing the results of generated digits to assess the performance and capabilities of the DCGAN model.

## Getting Started
